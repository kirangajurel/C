12. How is malloc() function different from calloc()  function?
-
	This Malloc() is different from Calloc() by following ways;

	Malloc:
	-The name malloc stands for memory allocation, whereas 
	The name calloc stands for contiguous allocation.


	-Malloc() takes one argument that is, number of bytes, whereas 
	Calloc() take two arguments those are: number of blocks and size of each block.

	-syntax of malloc(): void *malloc(size_t n); whereas
	syntax of calloc(): void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size);
	 
	-Allocates n bytes of memory. If the allocation succeeds, a void pointer to the allocated memory is returned.
	 Otherwise NULL is returned. Whereas
	 Allocates a contiguous block of memory large enough to hold n elements of sizebytes each. The allocated region is
	 initialized to zero.
	 

	-Malloc is faster than calloc, Whereas
	Calloc takes little longer than malloc because of the extra step of initializing the allocated memory by zero.
