7.  Explain the pointer to structure with example.
-
	1.Address of Pointer variable can be obtained using ‘&’ operator.
	2.Address of such Structure can be assigned to the Pointer variable.
	3.Pointer Variable which stores the address of Structure must be declared as Pointer to Structure.
	
	-	Basically a pointer to a structure means to user pointer to access and manipulate data/memory of the structure.
	
	   Syntax for Pointer to Structure: 
	   
	   struct student_database
	   {
		   char name[10];
		   int roll;
		   int marks;
		}stud1;
	   struct student_database *ptr;
	   ptr = &stud1;
	   
	   And there is mainly two ways to do this:
	1.Referencing pointer to another address to access memory
	2.Using dynamic memory allocation
Example:
/*
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
          struct student_database
{
    char name[10];
    int roll;							
    int marks;
}stud1;								

stud1.roll = 10;
stud1.marks = 90;

printf("Roll Number : %d\n",stud1.roll);
printf("Marks of Student : %d\n",stud1.marks);

return 0;
