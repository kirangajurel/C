10.	What are the advantages of dynamic memory allocation over static memory allocation?
-
	-When main memory is allocated statically it cannot be altered during the execution of program.When main memory
	 is allocated dynamically it can be altered during the execution of program as per the user wish.
	 
	-The length of dynamically allocated memory either can be decreased or increased.
	
	-In case of dynamically created lists insertions and deletions can be done very easily just by the manipulation
	 of addresses whereas in case of statically allocated memory insertions and deletions lead to more number of movements and wastage of memory.
	 
	-In case of statically allocated memory there is every chance of “overflow”  during insertions in the lists,
	 whereas in case of dynamically allocated memory it does not come into picture unless otherwise unavailability
	 of main memory.
