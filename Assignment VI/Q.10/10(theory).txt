9.	What is Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA)? How can you use it in C?
-
	C dynamic memory allocation refers to performing manual memory management for dynamic memory allocation in the C 
	programming language via a group of functions in the C standard library, namely malloc, realloc, calloc and free.
	Although, C language inherently does not have any technique to allocate memory dynamically, there are 4 library functions
	under "stdlib.h" for dynamic memory allocation.

	Function And Use of Function
	
	malloc(): Allocates requested size of bytes and returns a pointer first byte of allocated space.
	
	calloc(): Allocates space for an array elements, initializes to zero and then returns a pointer to memory.
	
	free(): Deallocate the previously allocated space.
	
	realloc(): Change the size of previously allocated space.

	Now, for example: 
	
	Syntax of malloc()
	ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)
